Welcome to regretless.com! My name is Ying Zhang and I'm a professional programmer and web designer. I specialize in responsive web design and Java web applications. I currently work full time as a Sr. Systems Engineer for Meredith on their parents.com team.  In my spare time, I enjoy writing on <a href="http://pure-essence.net/" title="pure-essence.net">my blog pure-essence.net</a> and create WordPress themes.  These days I also play on <a href="http://codepen.io/dodozhang21/">codepen.io</a>. Regretless.com is a portfolio for my free WordPress themes and other hobby websites. Happy browsing!
